Because hygiene is important, unlock yourself regularly to clean your chastity device. Be careful, if you exceed the allowed time, you will receive a penalty.

## Introduction

The Hygiene Opening extension allows you to temporarily unlock your lock, to clean your chastity device, or for any other reason. The time between each unlocking is by default two days, and can be modified according to your needs. When you start your lock, you will have to wait for the configured time before unlocking temporarily for the first time.

When you are unlocked, you will have a set time to clean up or whatever, which defaults to 15 minutes. This time includes the time to unlock and relock yourself. If you exceed this time, a penalty will be applied and time will be added, by default 12 hours.

The keyholder can temporarily unlock you at any time.

## Options

If you select the option "Allow only the keyholder to open the lock temporarily", you will not be able to unlock yourself temporarily, only the keyholder will be able to do so. Please note that if you do not have a keyholder, you will not be able to use the extension if this option is enabled.
