## Introduction

Welcome to the Chaster Public API documentation! You can use the API to create all kinds of applications, and use the features of Chaster: connected lock box, extensions and games, or even bots.

The purpose of this documentation is to guide you and show you how our system works, so that you can create great applications for users.

## Locks and applications

Chaster has a unique system of extensions, which allows you to simply and quickly develop your own game or extension linked to a user's session. These applications can be simple or complex, from the connection with a connected lock to the creation of a game.

You can also develop an application for yourself, to control your locks or locked users. You can also connect our system to yours and create shared locks, the possibilities are endless.

## Beta version

Chaster is currently in beta, therefore features can be modified or removed at any time. Available endpoints are subject to change, we invite you to follow our Discord regularly to see the changes.
