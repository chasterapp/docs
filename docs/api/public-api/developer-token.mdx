The developer token allows you to access and use the Public API using your Chaster account. This is an easy way to use the Chaster API.

:::info
If you are going to create an application that can be used by other Chaster users besides yourself, you can use [OAuth 2 authentication](/api/public-api/oauth-2), which will allow other users to log into their account and use your application.

## Generate a developer token

Here are the steps to generate a developer token:

1. On the [Chaster developer interface](https://chaster.app/developers/applications), open your application page and click on "Tokens" in the sidebar. The account associated with the token is displayed.
2. Click on the button "Generate a developer token" to generate a developer token for your account.

You now have a developer token, which you can use for Public API requests.

## Application scopes

A developer token is granted all scopes available and can use all endpoints.
