Before an extension can be made available to all Chaster users, it needs to go through a review process to ensure it meets the necessary standards and guidelines. Here is an overview of the review process.

## Develop and test your extension

During the development phase, your extension will be in test mode. You will design and build your Chaster application using the Extensions API and other necessary tools. Follow the current documentation and guidelines to ensure your application integrates seamlessly with the platform. Take the time to develop and test each feature, ensuring that they function as intended and provide a smooth and intuitive user experience. Conduct comprehensive testing to identify and resolve any issues or bugs that may arise.

If you need any assistance or have questions during the development process, don't hesitate to reach out to the Chaster team. We are here to provide support and guidance to help you successfully implement your application. You can contact us on Discord, where we have a dedicated developer community. By joining the community, you can interact with fellow developers, share ideas, seek advice, and get the support you need.

## Validation

When you believe your application is ready for review and validation, reach out to us via Discord or by email, and we will guide you through the process, ensuring your application meets our requirements.

After you submit your application for review, our team will carefully examine its functionality, integration, and adherence to [our guidelines](/api/extensions-api/guidelines). We may provide feedback or request further adjustments to enhance the user experience or address any concerns.

Once your application successfully passes the review process, it can be released to Chaster users. It will be made available in the Chaster application, allowing users to access and interact with your extension.

## Join the Discord community

We encourage you to join the Chaster developer community on Discord to connect with other developers, share ideas, and seek support. The community provides a platform to discuss your application, gather feedback, and collaborate with like-minded individuals. Within the Discord server, you can participate in relevant channels such as **[#ðŸ’¡â”ƒapi-support](https://discord.com/channels/710587363918741604/1123354084381032478)**, where you can create threads specific to your application and engage with the Chaster team.
