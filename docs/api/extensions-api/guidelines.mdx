To ensure a safe, reliable, and enjoyable environment for all, every extension must align with our guidelines and expectations. These guidelines cover compliance, functionality, security, user experience, performance, and content standards.

Please note that compliance with these guidelines is not just a prerequisite for getting your extension published initially; it's an ongoing commitment. Even after your extension is live, we may periodically revalidate it to ensure it continues to meet these standards.

## 1. Compliance with Guidelines

Chaster expects all extensions to comply with its guidelines, policies, and terms of service. This includes:

- **Legal Compliance**: Ensure that your extension adheres to all applicable laws and regulations. Avoid any content, functionality, or behavior that could result in legal issues.

- **Ethical Standards**: Develop your extension with high ethical standards in mind. Avoid promoting or facilitating harmful, abusive, or discriminatory content or behavior.

## 2. Functionality

Chaster expects your extension to deliver on its promised functionality. Here's what we look for:

- **Accuracy**: Your extension should perform its intended functions accurately and reliably. Test thoroughly to ensure that all features work as described.

- **No Harmful Effects**: Your extension should not introduce any bugs, security vulnerabilities, or other issues into the Chaster platform.

## 3. Security

Security is a top priority for Chaster. Here's what we expect regarding security:

- **Data Protection**: Ensure that any user data your extension collects or processes is handled with the utmost care and in compliance with data protection regulations. Always prioritize user privacy and data security.

- **Authentication**: Use secure authentication mechanisms to access Chaster APIs. Never expose sensitive credentials, such as your private API key, in client-side code. Keep your API key confidential and avoid hardcoding it in your extension client-side JavaScript. Leaking your private API key in the browser client could lead to security vulnerabilities.

- **No Vulnerabilities**: Your extension should not introduce security vulnerabilities, such as XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) or SQL injection, into the Chaster platform.

## 4. User Experience

A positive user experience is essential. Here's what we look for:

- **Intuitive Design**: Design your extension user interface to be intuitive and user-friendly. Users should easily understand how to use your extension.

- **Responsiveness**: Your extension should respond promptly to user interactions, providing a smooth and responsive experience.

## 5. Performance

Your extension should not negatively impact the Chaster platform performance. Here's what we expect:

- **Efficiency**: Optimize your extension code to ensure it doesn't consume excessive server resources or cause slow loading times. Prefer using webhooks over polling to fetch data from Chaster APIs and avoid making unnecessary API calls.

- **Compatibility**: Ensure that your extension works smoothly across various devices, browsers, and operating systems.

## 6. Content

Content should align with Chaster guidelines. Here's what we expect:

- **Respectful Content**: Avoid content that is offensive, harmful, or discriminatory. Respect the diverse Chaster community.

- **Respect Laws**: You may not sexualize minors in any way, and you should not promote, encourage or engage in any illegal behavior.

- **Transparency**: Be transparent about your extension functionality and any user data it collects or uses. Avoid misleading or deceptive messaging.

- **Adult Content**: Chaster is only accessible to users who are 18 years or older. You are allowed to publish extensions that contain adult content, such as pictures or videos.

By following these expectations for each criterion, you can increase the likelihood of your extension being accepted on Chaster platform. Prioritizing compliance, functionality, security, user experience, performance, and respectful content will contribute to a positive experience for Chaster users and help maintain the integrity of the platform.
