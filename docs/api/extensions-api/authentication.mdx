To interact with user sessions and create your extension, you will need to make calls to the Extensions API. The API requires authentication using your developer token.

## Make a request to the Extensions API

All endpoints to the Extensions API start with `/api/extensions`. The list of available endpoints is available here: [https://api.chaster.app/api/](https://api.chaster.app/api/). To authenticate and use these endpoints, you need to generate a developer token for your account and using the same application as your extension.

- Go to your Developer interface, and select your application
- In the left sidebar, select “Tokens”
- If you don’t have a token yet, generate it.

This token is a bearer token. To make a request, simply send this token in the `Authorization` header:

```
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```

For example, if you want to fetch a session, you would use the endpoint `GET /api/extensions/sessions/:sessionId` and call it like this:

```bash
curl \
  --location 'https://api.chaster.app/api/extensions/sessions/:sessionId' \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer <token>'
```

Replace `<token>` with your developer token.
