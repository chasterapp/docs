## Introduction

Chaster is a keyholding application for chastity wearers and keyholders. With Chaster, create custom time-based locks and join new adventures made for you. Lock yourself in chastity in one of hundreds of locks created by the community, or create your own custom lock.

## Overview

Chaster locks work with a key lock box, where the combination can be changed. To begin a session, set a combination randomly, without looking at it, and take a picture of it. Lock your chastity cage, and put your key in the lock box. Then shuffle the code of your lock box, so you can't open it anymore.

You can now configure your lock and upload the combination picture on Chaster. Once the session started, you won't be able to retrieve the combination back until the timer ends.

## Extensions

The key feature of Chaster is the extension system. Extensions let you configure your locks with an infinite number of possibilities. You can combine multiple extensions to customize your session and create your own chastity experience.

## Getting started

The following guide will help you use the application and create your first locks. You will see how to add extensions to add features, games or challenges to your session.
