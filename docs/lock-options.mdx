## Create a lock

By creating a lock, you can configure its options to get the experience of your choice.

### Display remaining time

The timer corresponding to the remaining time will be displayed if the option is enabled. If it is disabled, the timer will be hidden. If the lock has a keyholder, only he will be able to see the remaining time. The keyholder can also enable or disable the timer display at any time.

The remaining time is displayed by default.

### Display time information from history

By enabling this option, time changes will be displayed in the lock history. If the option is disabled, all time updates will be hidden in the history.

The time information is displayed by default.

### Limit lock time

Many factors can change the duration of your lock: time modification by your keyholder, visitor votes, or pillory among others. You can limit the maximum time of a lock by activating this option: you will be sure to be released at the latest at the defined duration, regardless of other factors.

The limitation is disabled by default. If you are a beginner, we advise you to enable this option in order not to be locked longer than expected.

You can set the maximum lock time or date, or leave the default maximum initial lock duration.

### Offer your session

Offer your session to a keyholder to allow them to control your lock.
