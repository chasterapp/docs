## Introduction

A lock can have different statuses depending on the actions of the wearer and the keyholder.

### Locked

When your lock is locked, you do not have access to your combination. To unlock yourself, you have to wait until the end of the time limit, and have completed the actions required by each extension. Extensions may prevent you from unlocking until you complete certain actions. For example, the Shared Links extension may require a certain number of visits to your session link before allowing unlocking.

Once you have completed the unlocking restrictions, you can unlock by clicking the "Ready to unlock" button on your lock page. This action is not done automatically, you must unlock manually.

When your lock is in "Ready to unlock" status, time can still be added, or extensions can still re-block the unlocking.

The keyholder can unlock your lock at any time and make the combination accessible.

### Unlocked

When you have clicked the "Ready to unlock" button and you unlock your lock, it changes to "Unlocked" status. You will be able to access your image or code combination. You can then archive your lock and create a new one. Once your lock is archived, you can find its information in the list of archived locks.

### Deserted

You can stop a lock prematurely by deserting your lock. To do this, go to your lock settings, then click on "Archive". Be careful, if you archive a lock that is in progress, you are considered a deserter and your combination will not be displayed back to you. The keyholder will see the session as deserted.

:::caution
Warning: it is frowned upon to desert a keyholder lock without notifying them, it can affect your reputation. Ask your keyholder to unlock you instead.

## Frozen lock

Your keyholder or extensions can freeze your lock. When your lock is frozen, the time is also frozen and will not decrease, and you will not be able to unlock. Be careful to configure your lock when you use extensions that allow you to freeze your lock. Remember to configure at least one extension that will allow you to unfreeze your lock, or entrust your session to a keyholder who can unfreeze you.
