With the Penalties extension, receive penalties when you don't perform your tasks and actions on time.

## Introduction

The Penalties extension allows you to configure a minimum number of actions to be performed for a given frequency (daily, weekly, etc.). If this number of actions is not respected, you will receive a penalty corresponding to the configuration of the lock.

## Configuration

Before activating the Penalty extension and being able to configure your penalties, you must first activate and configure the other extensions so you want to activate a penalty. For example, if you want to force yourself to perform 5 tasks per day, you can activate the Tasks extension and configure it.

Once the other extensions are configured, you can activate the penalties in the Penalty extension configuration. Then choose the actions for which you want to activate a penalty.

There are two types of actions offered by the extension: recurring actions and time-limited actions.

### Recurring actions

Recurring actions are actions that you will need to do regularly, depending on the number and frequency you choose. You can configure the minimum number of actions to be performed, as well as the frequency: per day, per week, per month.

For recurring actions, the period starts as soon as the lock is created, and repeats itself at the chosen frequency. For example, if you choose one action per day, and you create your lock on a Monday at 3pm, you will have to complete the action before Tuesday 3pm, then the next one between Tuesday 3pm and Wednesday 3pm, and so on.

Actions are not cumulative: by doing more actions than requested, the additional actions will not count for the next period.

Examples of actions are rolling dice, assigning a task, or adding a verification picture.

### Time-limited actions

Time-limited actions are triggered when you start the relevant action. From that moment on, you will have to complete the action within the allotted time, otherwise you will receive a penalty.

Examples of actions are time to relock after unlocking temporarily, or time to complete a task.

### Consistent configuration

:::caution
Make sure that the configuration allows you to complete the tasks on time. If in the Penalty extension you force yourself to do one action per day, do not configure this extension to be able to do the action every two days.
:::

In general, it's up to you to make sure your configuration is consistent. Check that the configuration of the other extensions, including the mode (cumulative, non-cumulative) and time, allows you to perform your actions without receiving penalties.

## Penalties

Once you have defined the number and frequency of your actions, you can configure the penalties that will be applied when you have not reached the action objective or respected the time limit. You can select one or more penalties, all of which will be applied in case of a penalty.

The possible penalties are adding time, pillorying and freezing. Be careful if you select the freeze option, make sure you have another method to unfreeze yourself, either through your keyholder or through other extensions, otherwise you risk being frozen indefinitely!
