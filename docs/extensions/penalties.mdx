With the Penalties extension, receive penalties when you don't perform your tasks and actions on time.

## Introduction

The Penalties extension allows you to configure a minimum number of actions to be performed for a given frequency (hourly, daily, weekly, etc.). If this number of actions is not respected, you will receive a penalty corresponding to the configuration of the lock.

## Configuration

Before activating the Penalty extension, you must first activate and configure the relevant extensions that you want to associate with penalties. For example, if you want to receive penalties for not completing tasks on time, you first need to activate and configure the Tasks extension.

Once the relevant extensions are configured, you can activate the penalties in the Penalty extension configuration. Then, select the specific actions from those extensions for which you want to enable penalties.

There are two types of actions offered by extensions: recurring actions and time-limited actions.

### Recurring actions

Recurring actions are actions that you will need to do regularly, depending on the number and frequency you choose.

#### Number of actions required

You can configure the minimum number of actions to be performed for a recurring action. This determines how many times you need to complete the action during each regularity period.

#### Regularity

You can configure the frequency of a recurring action, which can be set to a specific number of hours (ranging from 1 hour to 24 hours) or days (ranging from 1 day to 30 days). By default, the frequency is set to every day, but you can customize the repeat interval to fit your needs.

For recurring actions, the period starts as soon as the lock is created and aligns with your day, starting and ending based on your profile's timezone. For example, if you choose one action per day and you create your lock at 5pm, the period will start at 5pm and end at midnight, and the next period will start at midnight and end at 11:59pm the following day.

:::info
Actions are not cumulative: if you complete more actions than the minimum number required for a given period, those additional actions will not count towards the next period.
:::

Examples of actions that can trigger penalties include rolling dice, assigning tasks, or adding verification pictures.

### Time-limited actions

Time-limited actions are triggered when you start the relevant action. From that moment on, you will have to complete the action within the allotted time. If you fail to complete the action within the specified timeframe, you will receive a penalty.

Examples of time-limited actions include the time to relock after unlocking temporarily, or the time to complete a task.

#### Maximum time allowed

You can configure the maximum time allowed to complete a time-limited action. This determines the timeframe within which you must complete the action to avoid receiving a penalty.

### Consistent configuration

:::caution
Make sure that the configuration allows you to complete the tasks on time. If in the Penalty extension you force yourself to do one action per day, do not configure this extension to be able to do the action every two days.
:::

In general, it's up to you to make sure your configuration is consistent. Check that the configuration of the other extensions, including the mode (cumulative, non-cumulative) and time, allows you to perform your actions without receiving penalties.

### Punishments

Once you have defined the number and frequency of your actions, you can configure the penalties that will be applied when you fail to meet the action objective or exceed the time limit. You can choose one or more penalties, which will all be applied in the event of a penalty.

The possible penalties are adding time, pillorying and freezing. Be careful if you select the freeze option, make sure you have another method to unfreeze yourself, either through your keyholder or through other extensions, otherwise you risk being frozen indefinitely.

## Extension

Once the lock is running, opening the Penalties extension will display a list of all your actions, including time-limited actions, hourly actions, and daily actions. For recurring actions, you'll see the time remaining to complete the action, as well as your progress, including the number of completed actions and the total number of actions required. For time-limited actions, you'll see the time remaining to complete the task. This allows you to easily track your progress and stay on top of your actions.

### Penalty history

You can access the history of previous penalty periods to see whether you've been punished or not. To view the history, click on a penalty action in the list of penalty actions.

Each penalty period can have one of the following statuses:

- Validated: You completed all required actions within the specified timeframe.
- Punished: You did not complete the required actions in time, and the associated punishment has been applied.
- Cancelled: A penalty period can be cancelled if the corresponding extension is disabled, or if the wearer is inactive.
