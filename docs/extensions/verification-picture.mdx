Regularly take a picture of your chastity device to show that you are locked.

## Introduction

With the Verification picture extension, prove to your keyholder and others that you are locked in your chastity device. When you launch a verification, a six digit code is generated. You need to include this verification code in your photo next to your chastity device. You can write it on paper, display it on a device screen, or use a timestamp application, whichever method you and your keyholder prefer. This proves that the photo was just taken and verifies the authenticity of your submission.

You can choose to check your session regularly with the non-cumulative mode, or whenever you want. The keyholder can also ask you for verification if he wants.

## Verification

You can enable verification to require that your submitted images are reviewed and validated before being accepted. When configuring verification, you can choose who can validate your submissions:

- **Community members**: Allows other members of the community to review and validate your images through a voting process
- **Only my keyholder**: Restricts validation to your keyholder only, keeping the verification process private

To learn more about how verification works, including the validation process and requirements for each mode, refer to the [Verification](/features/verification) documentation.

## Numbered seals

When community verification is enabled, you can add an extra layer of security to your verification pictures by using numbered seals. These tamper-proof, single-use plastic locks provide physical proof that your chastity device has not been removed or tampered with between verification submissions.

Numbered seals are only available when community verification is enabled on the Verification Picture extension.

### What are numbered seals?

Numbered seals are tamper-proof plastic locks with unique identification numbers printed on them. Once a seal is installed on your device, it cannot be removed without breaking it. The unique number can be photographed during each verification to prove the device remains continuously secured throughout your lock session.

### How to use numbered seals

#### First verification with a seal

1. Before taking your verification picture, attach a numbered seal to your chastity device alongside your regular locking mechanism
2. When submitting your verification picture, check the option to use a numbered seal
3. Enter the unique number printed on the seal (typically a 6-digit number)
4. Take your verification picture ensuring both the verification code and the seal number are clearly visible
5. Submit the picture for peer verification

Validators reviewing your submission will see the seal number you entered and verify it matches the number visible in your image.

#### Subsequent verifications

After your first verification is approved, the seal number is registered to your lock session. For all future verification pictures during this session:

- You must continue to show the same seal number in your photos
- Validators will check that the seal number matches the one registered to your session
- This proves the device has remained continuously locked with the same seal

:::info
The seal number is tied to your lock session. Each time you verify, validators confirm the seal hasn't been changed, providing proof of continuous wear.

### Hygiene opening and seal reset

If you use the [Hygiene opening](/extensions/hygiene-opening) extension to temporarily unlock your device for cleaning, you will need to break the numbered seal to remove the device.

When this happens:

1. After relocking, you can attach a new numbered seal with a different number
2. On your next verification picture submission, you'll be asked to enter the new seal number
3. This new seal will then be registered and used for all future verifications until the next hygiene opening

### Where to get numbered seals

Numbered seals (also called tamper-proof seals or security seals) are available from various online retailers and specialty stores. Look for:

- **Individually numbered plastic seals**: Each seal should have a unique number printed on it
- **Single-use design**: The seal should be designed to break when removed
- **Compatible size**: Ensure the seal can fit through the holes in your chastity device

Common sources include specialty chastity device retailers, industrial safety suppliers, and online marketplaces.

### Best practices

- **Take clear photos**: Ensure the seal number is clearly readable in every verification picture
- **Keep the seal intact**: Never attempt to remove or tamper with the seal between verifications
- **Stock up**: Purchase multiple seals in advance, especially if you plan to use hygiene openings
- **Document the number**: Note down your current seal number in case you need to reference it
- **Replace after openings**: Always use a new seal after each hygiene opening or lock removal
