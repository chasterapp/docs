Regularly take a picture of your chastity device to show that you are locked.

## Introduction

With the Verification picture extension, prove to your keyholder and others that you are locked in your chastity device. When you launch a verification, a six digit code is generated. You need to include this verification code in your photo next to your chastity device. You can write it on paper, display it on a device screen, or use a timestamp application, whichever method you and your keyholder prefer. This proves that the photo was just taken and verifies the authenticity of your submission.

You can choose to check your session regularly with the non-cumulative mode, or whenever you want. The keyholder can also ask you for verification if he wants.

## Peer verification

For enhanced community involvement, you can enable peer verification. This allows other members to review and validate your submitted images. To learn more about how peer verification works, including how to enable it and participate in validating others' images, refer to the [Peer verification](/features/peer-verification) documentation.
