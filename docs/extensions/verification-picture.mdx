Regularly take a picture of your chastity device to show that you are locked.

## Introduction

With the Verification picture extension, prove to your keyholder and others that you are locked in your chastity device. When you launch a verification, a six digit code is generated. You must write this code on a piece of paper, and take a picture of it next to your chastity device. This is to prove that you just took the picture.

You can choose to check your session regularly with the non-cumulative mode, or whenever you want. The keyholder can also ask you for verification if he wants.

## Peer verification

If the "Peer verification" option is enabled, other members of the site will be able to accept or reject your image. In the Verifications section of the site, the different member verification images are displayed, including those of this extension.

Once your picture is sent, members will have 12 hours to accept or reject your picture. If the majority of members accept it, your image is considered verified. If not, your image is rejected and you will receive the configured penalty.
