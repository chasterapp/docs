Extensions allow you to customize your lock and expand the possibilities. They are created by the Chaster team or by the community, and can be combined to get a unique experience.

There are different types of extensions: games, extensions adding new features, or connections to external services. It's up to you to choose the extensions that interest you. If you lack inspiration, check out [the list of public locks](https://chaster.app/explore) to create your own lock.

## Modes

Most extensions allow you to perform actions on a regular basis, to add more interactivity to your lock. For example, the Wheel of Fortune extension allows you to spin a wheel, or the Tasks extension to assign you a task to perform.

These actions can be configured to be performed at a given interval, for example allowing you to turn the wheel once every hour. There are different modes:

- **Non-cumulative**: When you perform an action, you will have to wait a certain amount of time before you can do it again. For example, if your lock is configured with a one-hour period, and you perform an action, you will have to wait an hour before you can do the action again.
- **Cumulative**: The number of possible actions is cumulated over time. For example, if your lock is configured with a one-hour period, and you wait four hours, you can perform the action four times.
- **Unlimited**: You can perform the action as many times as you want.

## Extension Limits

Free users can add up to three extensions to their locks. With a Chaster Plus subscription, you can add as many extensions as you want to create your perfect lock experience.

### Sharing Plus Benefits

When creating a lock with a keyholder, only one person needs to have a Chaster Plus subscription to unlock all the benefits:

- If you're a keyholder with Plus, you can create locks with unlimited extensions for any wearer
- If you're a wearer with Plus, you can create your own lock with unlimited extensions and share it with any keyholder

This means you can enjoy all the customization options of Chaster Plus even if your partner doesn't have a subscription.
