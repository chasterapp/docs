With every action, you and the bot roll a dice. If you do more than he does, time is removed. If the bot does more, time is added.

## Introduction

The Dice extension affects the time of your lock, and can add or remove time depending on your luck. When you use the extension, a six-sided die will be rolled for you. You will play against a bot, which will also roll a six-sided die.

- If the bot rolls higher than you, time will be added to your score.
- If you roll a higher result than the bot, time will be taken away from you.
- In case of a tie, the time is not modified.

## Configuration

### Time multiplier (in seconds)

The time multiplier indicates the time to add or remove from your lock. The difference between the dice values obtained is multiplied by this time multiplier, to give the final time to add or remove.
