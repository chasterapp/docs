## Introduction

Once your lock is started and in locked status, you can access the lock settings page to manage various aspects of your session. This page allows you to configure safety limits, manage keyholder permissions, and perform advanced actions on your lock.

## Lock settings

### Maximum lock date

When you create a lock, you can set a maximum lock date to ensure your lock cannot exceed a specific date. This acts as a safety feature, guaranteeing that you will be unlocked by the defined date regardless of any time additions from extensions, keyholders, or other features.

Once the maximum lock date is set, you can only extend this date further into the future; you cannot advance it to an earlier date.

If you have a maximum lock date configured, you can remove it. However, **this action is irreversible**: once you remove the maximum lock date, you cannot set it again for this lock. A lock without a maximum lock date cannot have one added later.

:::tip
If you're new to Chaster or trying new extensions, it's recommended to set a maximum lock date to avoid unexpectedly long sessions.
:::

:::caution
Removing the maximum lock date is permanent. Once removed, you cannot restore this safety limit for your current lock.

### Initial unlock date

This displays the original unlock date range that was randomly selected when you created your lock. This information is provided for reference and cannot be changed once the lock is started.

## Permissions

### Trust my keyholder

By default, your keyholder has limited control over your lock. They can add or remove time, freeze your lock, and perform basic actions, but they cannot modify your lock's configuration or extensions.

If you enable the "Trust my keyholder" option, you grant your keyholder extended permissions to modify your lock settings.

**When you trust your keyholder, they can:**
- Enable new extensions
- Edit current extension configurations
- Disable existing extensions

**What your keyholder cannot do (even when trusted):**
- Increase the maximum lock duration
- Archive your lock without your action

:::caution
Only enable this option if you have full confidence in your keyholder. This grants them significant control over your session, including the ability to add extensions that could extend or complicate your lock. **This action cannot be undone**: once you trust your keyholder, you cannot revoke this permission. Discuss with your keyholder before enabling this feature.
:::

When you click the "Trust my keyholder" button, a confirmation dialog will appear explaining these permissions.

## Advanced options

### Archive your lock

You can archive your lock at any time by clicking the "Archive" button. This action will permanently end your session and hide it from your home page.

:::caution
If you archive a lock that is still in progress (before the timer has elapsed), you will desert the lock. When a lock is deserted, **you will not receive your combination**. Your keyholder will also see that the session was deserted.

If you need to unlock early, contact your keyholder first and ask them to unlock you instead of deserting.
