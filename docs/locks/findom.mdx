## 🔍 What is a Findom?

A "Findom" is someone who requests any form of gift or payment in association with their activity as a keyholder, either on the Chaster app or on the Discord server.

This includes, but is not limited to:

* Wheel spins which encourage or require gift purchases.
* Requesting payment for early unlock or unfreeze.
* Asking for "one time fees" or "commitment fees".
* Pressuring users to buy things from a wishlist.
* Having a wishlist visible in your profile.

## ✅ Becoming a Findom: new verification process

:::info
Starting from June 2025, all Findoms must be manually verified through a multi-step application and identity verification process. Self-registration as a Findom is no longer possible. A Chaster Plus subscription alone is not sufficient.
:::

To ensure a safe and trustworthy environment, Chaster now requires all prospective Findoms to complete the following steps:

1. **📱 Participation as a regular user:** Learn the app and its dynamics as a non-Findom.
2. **✉️ Express interest:** Contact Chaster support to express your interest in becoming a Findom.
3. **📝 Application form:** Complete an application form providing personal and company details.
4. **🪪 Identity verification:** Submit ID and liveness verification.
    - **This process is strictly private:** your documents and verification data are only used for internal verification by Chaster and are never shared or displayed publicly.
    - **Internal verification process:** For now, ID and liveness verification will be handled by the Chaster Team. We plan to implement third-party ID verification services in the future.
5. **💳 Findom plan subscription:** If approved, subscribe to the Findom plan (a paid subscription separate from Chaster Plus) to appear as a Findom on the platform.
6. **✅ Approval and badge:** Once verified and subscribed, you will receive a "Verified Findom" badge and gain access to Findom features.

Only users who complete this process and are approved by the Chaster team can access Findom features.

## 👤 New Findom Profile Section

A new section will be added to the profile of verified Findoms to increase transparency and trust. This section will display:

* **Verified pictures:** Uploaded by the Findom. The Chaster team will verify that the person in the picture is the real person behind the account.
* **Intentions and offerings:** Information about what the Findom offers and their intentions.
* **Payment methods:** Details on how the Findom accepts payments.
* **Dispute handling:** Details on how disputes are managed and disagreements resolved.


### 🖼️ Verified Pictures Policy

To help build trust and authenticity, Chaster offers **verified pictures** for Findoms in a new section of their profile. Here's how it works:

* **🔍 What does verification mean?**
  The Chaster team confirms that the person in the picture is the actual owner of the account, using a private **liveness verification** process. This ensures the image truly represents the account holder.

* **📷 What do I need to submit?**
  You’ll need to privately send us a photo that includes part of your face. This image is **never made public** and is used solely to verify your identity.

* **👀 Do I need to show my face publicly?**
  **No.** You can choose to display a **non-identifying** public image, such as:

  * A cropped version of your verified photo
  * A masked or aesthetic photo
  * Any other image, as long as it can be matched to your private verification

* **🌐 Who controls what's public?**
  **You do.** Only the photos you explicitly mark as public will appear on your profile.

* **☑️ Do I need to add a verified picture to my profile?**
  **No.** You can choose not to add a verified picture to your profile.

In summary: You can stay anonymous publicly, as long as Chaster can privately verify that you are the person in the picture.


## 📃 Findom Rules

* **Verified Findoms only:** Only users with the "Verified Findom" badge can create Findom locks, mention tributes or payments, show wishlists, or appear in Findom search/filter results.
* **No initiation of contact:** Verified Findoms are not allowed to initiate contact with other users through Chaster messaging, Discord DMs, or friend requests. Wearers interested in Findom experiences must contact Findoms first.
* **Transparency:** All Findom-related information (intentions, payment methods, dispute handling, social links) will be publicly displayed on the Findom's profile.
* **Compliance:** All Findoms must comply with Chaster's rules and the requirements of the Findom plan. Non-compliance will result in suspension and removal of Findom status.

If you encounter any users offering Findom services without a "Verified Findom" badge, please report them to Chaster support.

## 🔒 Data Deletion & Privacy

If you have questions or concerns about your personal data, here is what you should know:

- **Right to deletion:** You can request the deletion of your data at any time by simply contacting Chaster support. We will promptly process your request and remove your information from our systems.
- **No retention of ID/liveness media:** Any pictures or videos submitted for ID and liveness verification are used solely for the purpose of verifying your identity. These files are **not stored after verification**—they are deleted immediately after the verification process is complete. We do not keep copies of your ID or liveness verification media.
- **Control over profile information:** All information displayed in the Findom profile section, including verified pictures, can be edited or deleted by the Findom at any time. If you wish to remove a verified picture or any other detail from your profile, you can do so yourself directly from your account settings.
