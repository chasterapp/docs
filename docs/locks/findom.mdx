## What is a Findom?

A "Findom" is someone who requests any form of gift or payment in association with their activity as a keyholder, either on the Chaster app or on the Discord server.

This includes, but is not limited to:

* Wheel spins which encourage or require gift purchases.
* Requesting payment for early unlock or unfreeze.
* Asking for "one time fees" or "commitment fees".
* Pressuring users to buy things from a wishlist.

This does not include:

* Having a wishlist visible in your profile.

## Findom Rules

:::info
From July 1st 2023 onwards, all findom activities on Chaster will require a [Chaster Plus](https://chaster.app/plus/findoms) subscription.
:::

To ensure a safe and respectful environment for all users, there are specific rules and guidelines to follow when engaging in findom activities on Chaster.

* **Chaster Plus Subscription**: Findoms must have an active Chaster Plus subscription. This subscription provides access to exclusive features and benefits specifically designed for findoms.
* **Setting the "Findom" Tag**: Findoms must set the "Findom" tag on their profile. This can be done in the profile settings.
* **No Initiation of Contact**: Findoms are not allowed to initiate contact with other users through the Chaster messaging feature, Discord DMs and friend requests. This means findoms cannot be the first to send a message when reaching out to other users. Wearers interested in findom experiences should contact the findoms first.
* **Enabling "Findom Lock" Option**: When creating a chastity lock that requires payment from the wearer, findoms must enable the "Findom lock" option during the lock creation process. This clearly communicates to wearers that payment is required for the lock.

Adhering to these findom rules ensures a positive and consensual experience for both findoms and users on Chaster. Failure to comply with these rules will result in account suspension.

If you encounter any findoms who are not adhering to these rules, please report them to us. Reporting non-compliant findoms helps us ensure the integrity of the platform and protect the well-being of our community. To report a findom who is violating the rules or engaging in inappropriate behavior, please contact our support team and provide as much information as possible.
