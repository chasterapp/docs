## What is a Findom?

A "Findom" is someone who requests any form of gift or payment in association with their activity as a keyholder, either on the Chaster app or on the Discord server.

This includes, but is not limited to:

* Wheel spins which encourage or require gift purchases.
* Requesting payment for early unlock or unfreeze.
* Asking for "one time fees" or "commitment fees".
* Pressuring users to buy things from a wishlist.
* Having a wishlist visible in your profile.

## Becoming a Findom: new verification process

:::info
Starting from June 2025, all Findoms must be manually verified through a multi-step application and identity verification process. Self-registration as a Findom is no longer possible. A Chaster Plus subscription alone is not sufficient.
:::

To ensure a safe and trustworthy environment, Chaster now requires all prospective Findoms to complete the following steps:

1. **Participation as a regular user:** Learn the app and its dynamics as a non-Findom.
2. **Express interest:** Contact Chaster support to express your interest in becoming a Findom.
3. **Application form:** Complete an application form providing personal and company details.
4. **Identity verification:** Submit ID and liveness verification. Your profile picture must match your ID and will be displayed publicly.
5. **Contract and payment:** If approved, sign a contract with Chaster and select a plan.
6. **Approval and badge:** Once verified, you will receive a "Verified Findom" badge and gain access to Findom features.

Only users who complete this process and are approved by Chaster team can access Findom features.

## Findom Rules

* **Verified Findoms only:** Only users with the "Verified Findom" badge can create Findom locks, mention tributes or payments, show wishlists, or appear in Findom search/filter results.
* **No initiation of contact:** Verified Findoms are not allowed to initiate contact with other users through Chaster messaging, Discord DMs, or friend requests. Wearers interested in Findom experiences must contact Findoms first.
* **Transparency:** All Findom-related information (intentions, payment methods, dispute handling, social links) will be publicly displayed on the Findom's profile.
* **Compliance:** All Findoms must comply with Chaster's rules and the terms of their contract. Non-compliance will result in suspension and removal of Findom status.

If you encounter any users offering Findom services without a "Verified Findom" badge, please report them to Chaster support.

## Reporting Unverified Findoms

To maintain the integrity of the platform, report any user offering Findom services without the "Verified Findom" badge. Provide as much information as possible to help our support team investigate.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### What is the Findom lock feature?

The Findom lock feature allows verified keyholders to mark locks as "Findom locks", indicating that payment is required for a chastity session. Only users with the "Verified Findom" badge can create these locks.

### Why do Findom activities now require verification?

Verification helps maintain a safer and more reliable environment. It ensures that only trusted, vetted individuals can offer Findom services, reducing the risk of scams and abuse.

### How do I apply to become a Findom?

Contact Chaster support to express your interest. You will be guided through the application, identity verification, and contract process.

### What happens if I'm currently a Findom without verification?

We will be conducting a progressive migration for existing Findoms. Over the next few weeks, current Findoms will be contacted directly with instructions on how to complete the new application and identity verification process. Until you are contacted, you will retain access to Findom features. However, completion of the migration will be required to maintain Findom status in the future.

### Does the Findom feature give me access to Chaster Plus features?

Yes, Chaster Plus features are available to verified Findoms. This includes unlimited locks and extensions, image combination verification, early access to new features, and the ability to support Chaster's development.

### Can I participate in Findom activities as a wearer if I don't have a Chaster Plus subscription?

Yes! Wearers can engage with Findom locks and participate in sessions without a subscription. However, only verified Findoms can create Findom locks.

### How can I filter Findom locks as a wearer?

On the [explore page](https://chaster.app/explore), use the filter option to display only or exclude Findom locks. Only locks created by verified Findoms will appear.
