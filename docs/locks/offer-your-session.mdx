## Basics

You may choose to offer your lock to another Chaster member. This member can then become your keyholder and take control of your session: they can add or remove time, take actions on your lock, and much more.

To offer your lock, you must enable the "Offer your session" option when creating the lock. You can choose to indicate the username of your keyholder when creating the lock, or enter it later during the session.

:::tip
You can also use this feature to find a new keyholder if your current keyholder has resigned. When a keyholder resigns from your lock, your session continues as a self-lock, and you can select a new keyholder using this option.

## Steps

To offer your lock to another member, enter their username. This member will receive a keyholding request on the site, and will be able to see the lock information. He will then be able to accept or refuse this keyholding request.

If the request is accepted, this person will become your keyholder, and will be able to perform the basic actions. If the request is refused, your lock will not change, and you can make a new request to another person.

:::important
We recommend that you contact the keyholder before making a request, on Discord or by any other means of communication.

## Share your keyholding request

You can share your keyholding request with anyone, Chaster member or not, by using the link provided. Send the invitation link to your keyholder, who will be able to register or login to his or her account, accept your request and control your session.
