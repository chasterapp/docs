Validate other members' verification images through peer verification.

## Introduction

Peer verification enables community members to review and validate verification images submitted by others. These images currently verify a user's session, displaying their chastity device along with a verification code, or demonstrate the completion of assigned tasks.

This process is community-driven, allowing all members to participate in validating or rejecting submissions. Once a verification image is posted, it remains available for review for 6 hours. During this period, members can vote to approve or reject it.

After 6 hours, the submission is evaluated: if **at least 75% of the votes are approvals**, it is considered **validated**. If not, the submission is **rejected**, and the wearer receives a pre-configured penalty associated with the lock.

Peer verification is available for the following extensions:

- Verification Picture
- Tasks

## Requesting verification

In the configuration settings for your extension (e.g., Picture Verification or Tasks), enable the "Enable peer verification" option. You can also configure the penalties that apply if your image is rejected by the community.

Once you upload your image, you can monitor the verification status on the extension page. This includes indicators for "ongoing", "verified" or "rejected", along with the count of approval and rejection votes.

## Validating other members' images

To participate in validation, navigate to the verification page from your lock page or via the top-right menu. Here, you can view a list of all pending peer verification requests.

For each request, a list of specific checks will be displayed based on the type of verification. Common verification types include:

- **Chastity device**: Ensure the chastity device is securely locked and that the verification code matches the one visible in the image.
- **Tasks**: Ensure the image clearly demonstrates that the task has been completed as required, with sufficient evidence of adherence to the task's specifications.

If the submission meets all criteria, approve it. If it does not, reject it by selecting from multiple predefined rejection reasons. These reasons will be visible to the submitting user, helping them understand what went wrong and improve future submissions.

:::caution
Do not approve or reject images arbitrarily. Votes are analyzed post-review, and patterns of incorrect voting may result in penalties or restrictions on your ability to validate future images.
