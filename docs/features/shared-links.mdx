With shared links, share your lock with other people, and ask them to add or remove time. Configure the lock to require a certain number of visits before you can unlock.

## Configuration

Once your session is created, you will be able to send a shared link to everyone, which you can share on social networks, Discord, or anywhere. On this link, visitors will be able to add or remove you from the time, depending on the time set.

You can configure the time added and removed for each vote. You can also propose to the visitor to vote randomly, so he will have a button to make this choice.

:::info
Visitors can vote once per day and per IP address.

## Number of visits required

You can force yourself to share the link and your session with as many people as possible by activating the required number of visits. You will then need to reach the number of votes configured before you can release yourself.

Finally, you can limit the votes only to logged-in users.
