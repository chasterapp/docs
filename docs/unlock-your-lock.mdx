## How to unlock your lock

Once you've set up and started your lock, you'll eventually reach the point where you can unlock it.

### Conditions for unlocking

Your lock can be unlocked when all of the following conditions are met:
- The timer has elapsed.
- The lock is not frozen.
- No extensions are blocking the unlocking process.

### Unlocking process

When your lock can be unlocked, you'll see an "Unlock" button on your lock page.
- Click the "Unlock" button to end your session.
- You'll be shown the combination uploaded or entered previously to open your physical device.

### Limit lock time

If you've enabled the **Limit lock time** option when creating your lock, you have an additional safety feature. You'll be able to unlock your lock after the specified time limit, regardless of the lock's current status.

This feature ensures that you have a guaranteed unlock date, even if extensions or freezes are active.

### Important notes

- Always keep an emergency key or unlock method accessible, especially for longer sessions.
- If you're using a physical device, make sure you can safely remove it before starting a lock in case of emergency.
- Remember that some extensions, like the shared link extension, can block unlocking until certain conditions are met (e.g., for the [Shared links](/features/shared-links) extension, reaching a specific number of votes).

By following these guidelines, you can ensure a safe and controlled end to your chastity session.

## Early unlocks

Many users inquire about early unlocks for various reasons, including emergencies, finding a new keyholder, or simply wanting to end their session prematurely. While the mod team generally does not intervene in self-locks and cannot unlock running locks, there are specific situations where early unlocks are possible.

### Self locks

If you are self-locked, early unlocks are only considered in cases of misconfiguration:

- **Valid Reason**: A misconfiguration that prevents the user from completing tasks or unlocking their lock. The most common issue is an incorrectly set penalty delay.
  - In such cases, you should contact [support](/contacting-support) for assistance.

### Keyholder locks

For locks managed by keyholders, early unlocks may be possible under certain circumstances:

- **Inactive keyholder**: If the keyholder has been inactive for more than 7 days.
- **Disabled or suspended keyholder account**: If the keyholder's account is no longer active.

In such cases, you can either:
1. Unlock the lock immediately.
2. Continue running the lock as a self-lock, and enable session offer to potentially transfer the lock to a new keyholder.

### Deserted locks

A deserted lock occurs when a wearer archives a running lock. When deserted, the combination will not be displayed to the wearer after desertion. You can recover the combination picture or code 7 days after desertion by contacting [support](/contacting-support).
