Validate other members' verification images with peer verification.

## Introduction

Peer verification allows members to validate the verification images of other members. These images currently verify a person's session, showing their chastity device and code, but may also validate a person's tasks and actions in a future update.

Validation is community-based, all members can validate each other's images. When a person posts a verification image, it is online for 12 hours, and members can validate or reject the validation.

After 12 hours, if the majority of users validate the image, the image is considered validated. Otherwise, the image is rejected, and the user who posted the image will receive a penalty configured beforehand when creating the lock.

Verification is available for the following extensions:

- Verification picture

## Request verification

In the configuration of your extension (Picture Verification), activate the option "Enable peer verification". You can configure the penalties you will receive if users reject your image.

Once your image is uploaded, you will see the status of the verification on the extension page: in progress, verified, or rejected. You can also see the number of votes verified, and rejected.

## Validate other members' images

On the page of your lock, or in the menu at the top right, go to the verification page. Then follow the instructions to validate or reject the images that will be displayed to you. In general, just check that the code entered is correct, and that the chastity device is properly secured.

:::caution
Do not validate the images at random. Votes are analyzed afterwards, and a repetition of incorrect votes could add a penalty or even prevent you from validating new images.
