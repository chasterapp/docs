Extensions allow you to customize your lock and expand the possibilities. They are created by the Chaster team or by the community, and can be combined to get a unique experience.

There are different types of extensions: games, extensions adding new features, or connections to external services. It's up to you to choose the extensions that interest you. If you lack inspiration, check out [the list of public locks](https://chaster.app/explore) to create your own lock.

## Modes

Most extensions allow you to perform actions on a regular basis, to add more interactivity to your lock. For example, the Wheel of Fortune extension allows you to spin a wheel, or the Tasks extension to assign you a task to perform.

These actions can be configured to be performed at a given interval, for example allowing you to turn the wheel once every hour. There are different modes:

- **Non-cumulative**: When you perform an action, you will have to wait a certain amount of time before you can do it again. For example, if your lock is configured with a one-hour period, and you perform an action, you will have to wait an hour before you can do the action again.
- **Cumulative**: The number of possible actions is cumulated over time. For example, if your lock is configured with a one-hour period, and you wait four hours, you can perform the action four times.
- **Unlimited**: You can perform the action as many times as you want.
