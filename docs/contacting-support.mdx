Chaster has a small support team of enthusiastic volunteers who review reports and answer tickets. They are available most of the time to help deal with any problems that arise.

## When should I contact support?

Though the support team can try to help with any issue, there are certain types of common requests:

- You suspect another user of not complying with our rules (e.g. a findom without the "findom" tag).
- You think you've found a bug with Chaster.
- You're having an issue with your lock (such as accidentally making it impossible to complete).
- You were banned from the platform, and think this was in error.

## How do I contact support?

First, you'll need a Discord account, and to join the official Chaster discord server: https://discord.gg/chaster

Then, follow the instructions described in this post: [How To Use ModMail](https://discord.com/channels/710587363918741604/1071430444488347749)

You can usually expect a reply from one of our volunteers within a few hours.
